* Pixel 2
* Pixel 2XL
* iPhone 5/SE
* iPhone 6/7/8 (and plus)
* iPhone X
* iPad
* iPad Pro

All features are tested from viewports of 280px and above.




# Browser Testing <a name="browser-testing"></a>

 All browser testing was done with the same method above

 Problems usually occurred when my CSS was not compatible with most browsers. Running my CSS code through an Auto-Prefixer solved these compatibility issues.

## Chrome/Mircrosoft Edge

* All testing successful

## Mozilla Firefox

* All testing successful

## Safari

* All testing successful

## Internet Explorer

* My project uses ES6 which has compatibility issues with Internet Explorer. No further testing was made.

# Validation Testing <a name="validation-testing"></a>

 Validation testing was done with third party applications below:

## [W3 Vailidator](https://validator.w3.org/)

* HTML successfully passes W3 Validator

## [Jigsaw Validator ](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
* CSS successfully passes the W3 Jigsaw Validator
## [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

* JS Hint was used to flag any errors or mistakes in the javascript code and was used consistently throughout the development process.
* No errors are present 
* Warnings present are due to template literals syntax that is only valid with ES6, however by adding `/*jshint esversion: 6 */` at the top of the script this removes the errors and takes into consideration of ES6 compatibility.
